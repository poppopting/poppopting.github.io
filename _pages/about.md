I am a research engineer at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with Professor [Chih-Jen Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/).

My research interests include:

- **Extreme multi-label classification**, with active contributions to [LibMultiLabel](https://github.com/ntumlgroup/LibMultiLabel), a library for multi-class and multi-label classification.
- **Efficient machine learning**, focusing on **accelerating large language model (LLM) inference** and enabling **sparse computation**.

In addition, I help maintain [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/), well-established libraries for support vector machines and large-scale linear models.

Before joining MBZUAI, I spent three years working as a machine learning engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Yahoo, where I gained hands-on experience developing machine learning models and conducting data analysis for industrial applications.

I received my M.S. in Statistics from National Chengchi University, Taiwan, in 2020, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Chiu-Hsing Weng](https://chweng.video.nccu.edu.tw/), and my B.S. in Mathematics from National Central University, Taiwan, in 2018.
